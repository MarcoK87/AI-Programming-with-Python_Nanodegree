# AI-Programming-with-Python_Nanodegree
This repository contains the different programming tasks for the nanodegree program [AI Programming with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089) offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

## Curriculum

- **Introduction to Python**</br>
  _Start coding with Python, drawing upon libraries and automation scripts to solve complex problems quickly._
  
  :mortar_board: Project I: Use a Pre-trained Image Classifierto Identify Dog Breeds
  
- **Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib**</br>
  _Let's focus on library packages for Python, such as: Numpy (which adds support for large data), Pandas (which is used for data manipulation and analysis) and Matplotlib (which is used for data visualization)._
  
- **Linear Algebra Essentials**</br>
  _Learn the basics of the beautiful world of Linear Algebra and why it is such an important mathematical tool in the world of AI._

- **Calculus Essentials**</br>

- **Neural Networks**</br>

- **Create your own image classifier**</br>
  _In the second and final project for this course, you'll build a state-of-the-art image classification application._

## Project I: Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
The first project dealt with using a given image classifier in order to identify dog breeds. The focus was not on training or building the classifier, but on demonstrating the necessary Python skills for setting up a machine learning project, i.e. dealing with the data, looking at different metrics, inspecting results and run times of different classifiers.

_**Project Goal:** Improving your programming skills using Python_
